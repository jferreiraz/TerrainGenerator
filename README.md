### Project information:
<h4>

>Language: Java <br>
>Project focus: Terrain generator <br>
>Resources: were been used java on processing 4 ide.

### Description: 
<br>
This code was developed with the intention of generating irregular terrains indefinitely, the variables can be easily changed by changing the camera position, screen size, terrain size, generation speed and even the level and depth of irregularities.
Everything is commented and marked for better interaction with the code. I tried to forge an iridescent gray in the terrain generation.
The application was developed in java, there are several comments in the code lines explaining the functionality of each one.
